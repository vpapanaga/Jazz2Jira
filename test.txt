						rtc_cm:com.ibm.team.apt.attribute.acceptance 1) The application shall support the capability to display, side-by-side, both sides of a two-sided label format.<br/>2) Formats with printer type , <i>Two-Sided Thermal Printer, </i>can be edited and printed in two-sided mode, as well as single-sided mode.<br/>3) [EZMP-MISC-0030.2]&nbsp;&nbsp; When two-sided mode is turned on, Easy-Mark displays a second column of labels in the same format. The second column (on the right part of the display) represents the back side of the corresponding labels of the first column representing the front side (left side of the display).<br/>4) [EZMP-VIEW-0070.1][EZMP-MISC-0030.15]&nbsp; For each two-sided format, the user shall be able to define how the back-side label content would look relative to the front-side label content.&nbsp; The two options are “normal” and “inverted”.&nbsp; Normal means the back-side is oriented the same way as the front-side.&nbsp; Inverted means that the back-side is oriented 180 degrees relative to the front side. This setting shall be applicable to all labels within the current document.<br/>5) [EZMP-VIEW-0070.2] [EZMP-MISC-0030.8]&nbsp; For each two-sided format, the user shall be able to define whether the front and back side would have the “same content” or “different content”.&nbsp; “Same content” means that the label content for the back side shall automatically reflect the same content as the front side.&nbsp; “Different content” means that the user can enter the content for the front and back sides individually.&nbsp; This setting shall be applicable on a per label basis.<br/>6) [EZMP-VIEW-0070.3][EZMP-MISC-0030.3] For each two-sided format, the user shall be able to define whether the display will show “Print order” or “Edit order”.&nbsp; “Print order” means that the display will show the back-side labels exactly as they would be printed.&nbsp; “Edit order” means that the display will show the back-side labels in the same order as the front-side labels.<br/>7)&nbsp; [EZMP-VIEW-0070.4] There shall be an option to apply the settings of a particular two-sided format to all two-sided formats. This checkbox will allow the user to set the defaults for all two-sided formats rather than just the currently selected one.&nbsp; Setting this will allow any newly created two-sided label documents to use the same settings.<br/>8) [EZMP-MISC-0030.11] The function of the “tab” key during editing depends on the choice of “Same Content” or “Different Content”. In “Same” mode the user can only tab to labels on the front side of the document. In “Different” mode, tabbing alternates between the front and the back side.<br/>9) [EZMP-MISC-0030.13]&nbsp; The toolbar button will reflect the settings for the currently selected label.<br/>10) [EZMP-MISC-0030.14]&nbsp; If the label is empty the toolbar button shows the last setting which was made.<br/>11) [EZMP-MISC-0030.22]&nbsp; If a document contains different legend content between the front and back sides, and the user turns ON same content, the legends on the back side of the existing labels will remain untouched, allowing the user to enter and edit the legends.<br/>12) [EZMP-MISC-0030.23]&nbsp; However, any new legends created while the same content is turned on will disallow access to the back side of the label, keeping the content synchronized between front and back.<br/>13) [EZMP-MISC-0030.24]&nbsp; Functionality will be similar to the Wire Marker mode in that the flag will be both global for new labels as well as label-level for existing labels.<br/>14) [EZMP-MISC-0030.25]&nbsp; Any legend information created on the back side will be saved regardless of whether the display is in one- or two-sided mode.&nbsp; This will allow the user to switch back and forth without losing any data already entered.<br/>15) [EZMP-MISC-0030.26]&nbsp; The back side information will also be saved in the label file regardless of the display mode.&nbsp; However, when in single-sided mode, the legends on the back side of the labels will not print.<br/>16) [EZMP-MISC-0030.27]&nbsp; The very first time a two-sided printing format is selected for two-sided mode, a preferences dialog will appear (preferences should be set only one time for user per each format or all formats see Comment 2)<br/>17) Labels marked as same-content, cannot be included in any selection, on the back-side.<br/>18) Selected Labels that are marked as different-content, and are grouped on the back-side, would be removed from the group, if &quot;content&quot; mode is changed.&nbsp; User will be warned prior to completion.<br/>19) On the back-side, If a user tries to apply a Series across a &quot;Same-content&quot; label, the user is warned of the conflict and given a choice to resolve the conflict (change label to &quot;different-content or cancel).<br/>20) Selected labels that are marked as different-content, and contain elements of a series on the back-side, would be removed from the series (series is split), if &quot;content&quot; mode is changed to &quot;same&quot;.&nbsp; User will be warned prior to completion.<br/>21) Selected labels that are marked as different-content, and contain content on the back-side, would have back-side content overwritten by content from the front, if &quot;content&quot; mode is changed to &quot;same&quot;.&nbsp; User will be warned prior to completion.<br/>22) [EZMP-MISC-0030.19]&nbsp; When working in a single-sided document or in single-side mode of a two-sided printing document, pressing the F4 key will automatically copy the content of the label to the left of the currently selected label into the current label, replacing any content in the current label.<br/>23) [EZMP-MISC-0030.20]&nbsp; If the currently selected label is the left-most label in a row, no copying will take place.<br/>24) [EZMP-MISC-0030.21]&nbsp; If in two-sided mode with different content selected, the user will press the F4 key while in the back side label and the content from the corresponding front side label will be copied into the selected label, replacing any content with the front side labels<br/>.............<br/><br/><br/><b>Comments:</b><br/>- Comment 1 <b>On criteria 16:</b>&nbsp; to review the behavior for multi-user mode<br/>- Comment 2 Possibility to apply to any 2-sided formats (in dialog)<br/><br/>What story covers Two-sided printing wizard??<br/><br/>GED to confirm if possible to remove back-side labels from a back-side group, by switching content mode to same.

It self-corrected when applying formatting in a different area of the label. Another similar issue had overflow text in the horizontal direction, only when not in edit mode - task 30283 (DONE)<br/>1.5 If additional formatting is added while typing, the existing formatting buttons unhighlight. However, the highlight reappears upon typing - task 30284 (DONE)<br/>1.6 Highlighting text and changing formatting does not seem to enter the edit mode. Therefore, it does not activate the scrollbars. Therefore, trying to highlight the entire overflowed text is not possible - task 30285 (DONE)<br/>1.7 When a label (only) is selected (non-edit-mode), and there is already text content with some delimeters and varying levels of formatting, the new formatting does not apply to the whole content - task 30286 (DONE)<br/><br/>STORY 27351: ????<br/> If a format is selected from the ribbon dropdown (layout tab) and the “Add Document” button is clicked, a document is added, using the existing dropdown format, and the “Create Document” dialogue is displayed.&nbsp; Selecting a format in the window and clicking OK results in another document being created - task 30287 (DONE), close as out of date.<br/><br/>STORY 27352:&nbsp; NG<br/> Based on the criteria, this is a duplicate story (same as 27351).&nbsp; However, there is some confusion regarding “Landing page” criteria (see Discussion).&nbsp; As I understand it, there is no ability, currently, to add a “new document” to an existing project, from the Landing page - task 30288 (DONE)<br/> Based on the title/summary and description, this story should have produced the ability to add a document, from a dropdown list containing favorite or recent formats/templates.&nbsp; I don’t see that functionality in the current build - task 30289 (DONE)<br/><br/>STORY 27447: NG<br/> Criteria # 1 is the only thing satisfied for this story.&nbsp; More discussion needed - task 30290 (DONE)<br/><br/>STORY 27448: NG<br/> Description Column Filter is case sensitive - task 30291 (CLOSED AS NON ACTUAL)<br/> Format and Part # columns appear to be the same data.&nbsp; There is no ability to change the “Part #”, independently from the “Format”. - task 30292 (OPEN)<br/> There is no distinguishing parameter for “SYSTEM” vs. “CUSTOM” - task 30293 (DONE)<br/> Clone Format does not work as expected.&nbsp; The proposed format data is different from the original (GAP, Page width, etc.). Results in Obscure Constraint violation error - task 30294 (DONE)<br/> Panduit formats are able to be deleted and edited - task 30295 (DONE)<br/> User-defined formats cannot be edited or deleted in a later session, because they do not appear in the Format tables after the table is exited - task 30296 (DONE)

								dc:description--- 27146:<br/> If selected text has uniform size, but has other mixed formatting, the existing font size is not displayed.  If the selected text spans more than one line, and the second line contains a word (spaces on both ends), decreasing the font size does not seem to trigger a roll up of the word to the first line, when it can fit.  Under some circumstances (unknown), certain labels can become “stuck” and the text formatting can not be changed. However, it appears that certain actions, like typing until the text wraps, can fix the state of the label.  It appears that setting font to the maximum size on a small label (extreme overflow) cause significant anomolies and strange behavior on adjacent labels. One instance produced strange shifting (always down) of the text, each time the increase and decrease buttons were used. While trying to solve this issue (backspacing or deleting fantom spaces, etc.) the program crashed.

Imported data behave the same way as series<br/>4. Initial value from the data import applies to the selected textbox.&nbsp; Each additional value generates a new text box in the next sequential label.<br/>5. Existing Text Box content, in selected label, is appended with the first imported value.<br/>6. Each added Text Box is generated in a new label, with replicated content from the first text box and the next value from the import.<br/>7. If a label already exists, Text Box is added to label content.<br/>8. New labels are added if number of labels added exceeds the number of existing labels.<br/>9. After text box was generated, text box content is editable.<br/>10. If applicable destination labels are grouped, the text boxes will be added independently of the label grouping (like series).<br/>11. Data import Objects (textboxes) will be floating (not inline).<br/>12. All applicable text boxes are &quot;grouped&quot;.<br/>13. All members of a text box group share common properties (dimensions, location, border, global text decoration, etc.), but can have different content (contained text is not linked).<br/>14. If selecting a member of the text box &quot;group&quot;, and choosing to &quot;Delete&quot;, the user should be prompted to decide between &quot;delete all related text boxes&quot;, &quot;Delete selected text box&quot;, &quot;Cancel&quot;.&nbsp; If &quot;Delete selected textbox&quot;, the remaining textboxes remain grouped.<br/>15. &quot;Data Import Object&quot; function will be accessible by clicking button in the Objects area of the Ribbon.<br/>16. Data Import cannot be applied to text boxes that already contain series or previous data import.<br/>17. If data import is applied to a textbox that resides in a group of labels, any replications (due to label series) of the textbox are removed, prior to generating new instances, due to the data import.<br/>

When Dynamic length mode is switched OFF the label becomes fixed sized and all standard rules applied. <br/>8.&nbsp; When Dynamic length mode is switched OFF the label height property is fixed at the value of the longest label in the current document<br/>9.&nbsp; When Dynamic length mode is switched OFF a ribbon item becomes available that displays the label height property.&nbsp; The description displayed shall be &quot;Label Length&quot;<br/>10.&nbsp; When Dynamic length mode is switched &quot;OFF&quot; the ribbon item for setting &quot;Label Length&quot;&nbsp; allows the user to modify the label height property for the document.&nbsp; This height value is the same value that can be set from the document properties editing dialog.<br/>11.&nbsp; For the height setting in #10, clicking the up and down adjustment changes the value by 0.1<br/> 12. When Dynamic length mode is switched &quot;OFF&quot;&nbsp; and the label height property is changed, all labels in a document have that height and are redrawn on the page to have the new height.<br/>13 .

If user attempts to align wiremarker mode with dynamic height direction, the user must be made aware of the conflict and given a choice to &quot;Cancel&quot; or &quot;Disable Dynamic Height&quot;.<br/>21. If user selects more than one label and the labels have mixed modes, the Ribbon button will indicate that mode is &quot;off&quot;.&nbsp; When in this state, a click on the ribbon button will apply Wiremarker mode to all selected labels, and change the state of the button to &quot;on&quot;.<br/>22.

						rtc_cm:com.ibm.team.apt.attribute.acceptance 1. Peter should be able to define print offset, perform a test print/alignment test, and define the starting label, on the printed page.<br/>2. Print offset can be positive or negative numbers - presented in default document units (mm, inch).<br/>3. Offset can be applied to the &quot;Top&quot; (positive = vertical shift downward) or &quot;Left&quot; (positive = horizontal shift to the right). [EZMP-FILE-0160]<br/>4. Offset is the position of the horizontal /vertical corner of the label.<br/>5. The user must be offered a preview of the of how the offset will affect the output., within the offset dialog. [EZMP-FILE-0160]<br/>6. A &quot;Test Print&quot; feature shall allow the user to print a thin outline of the labels, rather than the actual content of the labels. [EZMP-FILE-0150.4] This feature provides the user with the ability to see how the application printout would “align” with the actual labels, without ruining the labels.&nbsp; This feature shall have 4 options for defining how the outlines/borders are applied:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) One label<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) One row<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) One column<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) One page<br/>7. The user shall have easy access between the print offset values and the test print feature.<br/>8. The Start Position feature shall provide the user with the ability to indicate the physical starting position on a sheet of labels by indicating the starting row and column.&nbsp; The starting row and column shall be validated against the actual number of rows and columns in the label format.&nbsp; See EZMP-FILE-150.5.<br/>9<i>. </i> There shall be an option to save the print offset.&nbsp; If selected, this option shall be persistent. [EZMP-FILE-0160.1]<br/>10. The saved offset should be applied to combination of specific printer and format.<br/>11. The saved Information about offset should be retained inside the system<i>.</i><br/>12.&nbsp; The system should be able to associate many formats with one printer and many printers with one format.<br/>13. The offsets should be implemented on the print, without the any of the content from the screen being clipped from the print, within the usable label space.<br/><br/>Comment:<br/>&nbsp; - If the printer have offset capabilities, we should use mentioned capabilities first and next use dialog.<br/>&nbsp; - Current Easy-Mark (3.7.26) functionality should be maintained.&nbsp; However, the user interface can be improved.<br/><br/>

						rtc_cm:com.ibm.team.apt.attribute.acceptance 1) CAD-CONNECT (v2.3 or v2.2) will be able to Start Easy-Mark Plus with the desired label format filled in (requires Easy-Mark Plus to be installed).<br/>2) Easy-Mark Plus will automatically utilize the format selected in CAD-CONNECT, if the format name exists in&nbsp; Easy-Mark Plus.<br/>3) If the format name, selected in CAD-CONNECT, does not match an Easy-Mark Plus format, a legacy import dialog will be presented to the user, for selection of an actual Easy-Mark Plus format.<br/>4) The imported data will be formatted according to format defaults.<br/><br/>Comments:<br/>&gt; Working with AutoCAD version 2002 thru 2016, and Visio (thru 2012).<br/>&gt; Connection is assured by ability of EMP to import the CAD-CONNECT generated files (.csv).<br/>&gt; New instance should be opened, file created, with document inserted.<br/>&gt; Can a new document be created within an existing instance/project?&nbsp; [OR-PV to verify with team.]<br/>&gt; Can an EASYMARK.csv file be created (user directed) for updating CAD-CONNECT database (in ..CAD-Connect/Data folder)?&nbsp; [GED to verify with team]<br/> 
						dc:title PETER is able to connect EasyMark Plus to CAD
						dc:description The main goal of CAD-CONNECT is to provide users the ability to collect identifiers (text) in an AutoCAD drawing or a Visio document in order to assist in printing them. It uses a wizard style dialog to select the label format, the desired identifiers, and the output format for printing labels.&nbsp; From CAD-CONNECT, This information is used to launch Easy-Mark (Plus) with a printable document, containing the selected identifiers.<br/><br/>EasyMark Plus (EMP) will be delicered with Original EasyMark (OEM) CAD Connect tool.????<br/><br/>Connection is assured by ability of EMP to import the OEM generated files.
			35588: CAD-Connect should have an ability to open old Easy-Mark or New Easy-Mark application from UI.

						dc:title CAD-Connect should have an ability to open old Easy-Mark or New Easy-Mark application from UI. 
						dc:description One use case for sending CAD-Connect data to Easy-Mark would be if a user with both Easy-Mark Plus and Easy-Mark needs to create a label file in Easy-Mark to send to another user (ie. through e-mail or network folder, etc.) because the second user (a customer of theirs perhaps) does not have Easy-Mark Plus.&nbsp; In this case, the first user would not want to go through Easy-Mark Plus, since Easy-Mark Plus files cannot be opened in Easy-mark.
